\section{Preliminaries}

\frame{\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item I'm a Principal Architect at Hortonworks
\item I work primarily on Data Science in the Hadoop Ecosystem
\item Prior to this, I've spent my time and had a lot of fun
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Doing data mining on medical data at Explorys using the Hadoop ecosystem
  \item Doing signal processing on seismic data at Ion Geophysical using MapReduce
  \item Being a graduate student in the Math department at Texas A\&M in algorithmic complexity theory
  \end{itemize}
\item I'm going to talk about Apache Pig's role for doing scalable data science.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Apache Hadoop}

\frame{\frametitle{Apache Hadoop: What is it?}
Hadoop is a distributed storage and processing system
\begin{itemize}
\item Scalable -- Efficiently store and process data
\item Reliable -- Failover and redundant storage
\item Vast -- Many ecosystem projects surrounding data ingestion, processing and export
\item Economical -- Use commodity hardware
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Apache Hadoop: Who is using it?}
\begin{figure}
   \includegraphics{hadoop_powered_by.png}
\end{figure}
}

\subsection{Apache Pig}

\frame{\frametitle{Apache Pig: What is it?}
Pig is a high level scripting language for operating on large datasets inside Hadoop
\begin{itemize}
\item Compiles scripting language into MapReduce operations
\item Optimizes such that the minimal number of MapReduce jobs need be run
\item Familiar relational primitives built in (i.e. [left, right, outer, cross] join)
\item Extensible via User Defined Functions for special processing
\end{itemize}
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Apache Pig: An Familiar Example}

\begin{lstlisting}
SENTENCES= load '...' as (sentence:chararray);
WORDS = foreach SENTENCES 
        generate flatten(TOKENIZE(sentence)) 
        as word;
WORD_GROUPS = group WORDS by word;
WORD_COUNTS = foreach WORD_GROUPS 
              generate group as word, COUNT(WORDS);
store WORD_COUNTS into '...';
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\section{Pig in the Data Science Toolbag}

\subsection{Understanding Your Data}

\frame{\frametitle{Understanding Data}
D.J. Patil in {\em Data Jujitsu}
\begin{quote}
"80\% of the work in any data project is in cleaning the data."
\end{quote}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Understanding Data}
A core pre-requisite to analyzing data is understanding data's shape and distribution.
This requires (among other things):
\begin{itemize}
\item Computing distribution statistics on data
\item Sampling data
\end{itemize}
A LinkedIn project called {\bf datafu}\footnote{http://github.com/linkedin/datafu} 
provides some of these tooling in the form of Pig UDFs:
\begin{itemize}
\item Computing quantiles of data
\item Sampling
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Uniform sampling by percentage (built into pig)
  \item Uniform sampling by reservoir sampling
  \item Weighted sampling without replacement
  \item Random Sample with replacement
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Case Study: Bootstrapping}
{\bf Bootstrapping} is a resampling technique which is intended to measure accuracy of sample estimates.  
It does this by measuring an estimator (such as mean) across a set of random samples with replacement
from an original (possibly large) dataset.
}

\frame{\frametitle{Case Study: Bootstrapping}
Datafu provides two tools which can be used together to provide that random sample with replacement:
\begin{itemize}
\item SimpleRandomSampleWithReplacementVote -- Ranks for every position in a k-sample multiple candidates and a score
\item SimpleRandomSampleWithReplacementElect -- Chooses, for every position in a k-sample, the candidate with the lowest score
\end{itemize}

See the javadocs for SimpleRandomSampleWithReplacement for an example of generating a boostrap of the mean estimator.
TODO: cite X Meng for this.
}

\subsection{Machine Learning with Pig}

\frame{\frametitle{What is Machine Learning?}
Machine learning is the study of systems that can learn from data.
The general tasks fall into one of two categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item Unsupervised Learning
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Clustering
  \item Outlier detection
  \item Market Basket Analysis
  \end{itemize}
\item Supervised Learning
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Classification
  \item Regression
  \item Recommendation
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Building Machine Learning Models with Pig}
Machine Learning at scale in Hadoop generally falls into two categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item Build one large model on all (or almost all) of the data 
\item Sample the large dataset and build the model based on that sample
\end{itemize} 
Pig can assist in intelligently sampling down the large data into a training set.  You can then use your favorite
ML algorithm (which can be run on the JVM) to generate a machine learning model.
}

\subsection{Applying Models with Pig}
\frame{\frametitle{Applying Models with Pig}
Pig shines at batch application of an existing ML model.  This generally is of the form:
\begin{itemize}
\item Train a model out of band
\item Write a UDF in Java or another JVM language which can apply the model to a data point
\item Call the UDF from a pig script to distribute the application of the model across your data in parallel
\end{itemize}
}


\section{Unstructured Data Analysis with Pig}

\frame{\frametitle{What is Natural Language Processing?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Natural language processing is the field of Computer Science, Linguistics \& Math that covers computer understanding and manipulation of human language.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Historically, linguists hand-coded rules to accomplish much analysis
  \item Most modern approaches involves using Machine Learning
  \end{itemize}
\item Mature field with many useful libraries on the JVM
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Apache OpenNLP
  \item Stanford CoreNLP
  \item MALLET
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Natural Language Processing with Large Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generally low-volume, complex analysis
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Big companies often don't have a ton of natural language data
  \item Dropped previously because they were unable to analyze
  \end{itemize}
\item Sometimes high-volume, complex analysis
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Search Engines
  \item Social media content analysis
  \end{itemize}
\item Typically many small-data problems in parallel
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Often requires only the context of a single document
  \item Ideal for encapsulating as Pig UDFs
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Natural Language Processing: Demo}

\begin{itemize}
\item Stanford CoreNLP integrated the work of Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, et al using recursive deep neural networks to
predict sentiment of movie reviews.
\item Let's look at how to encapsulate this into a Pig UDF and run on some movie review data.
\end{itemize}
