Cleveland Hadoop User Group on May 2014 -- Apache Pig as a Data Science Tool

You can find the presentation directly [here](https://github.com/cestella/presentations/blob/master/CHUG_Pig_for_Data_Science/src/main/presentation/Pig_for_DataScience.pdf?raw=true).

All example code is in this repo, is in Java and can be built with Maven. The code in this repository is Apache v2 licensed. However, the Stanford CoreNLP license is GPL (you can find a copy in the licenses directory). Enjoy!
